# Ecommerce-back-end

## Project 13

created express routes for a fake ecommerce business with 4 different sets of tables, with one to many, and many to many relationships. Used mysql and sequelize syntax

I would put screenshots here but, you know.
Theres also no heroku link or anything so, just trust me.
